Privacy Policy

Our app (“Compass Qibla”) uses your device’s location and compass sensors only to determine the Qibla (Kaaba) direction.

Information We Access

Location: Used locally on your device to calculate direction to the Kaaba. We do not store, transmit, or share your location.

Device identifiers: Certain Android system services (such as location and sensor APIs) may access device or other IDs. These are used only for the purpose of providing core compass functionality and are never collected or shared by us.

No Data Collection or Sharing
We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data. All calculations occur locally on your device.

Third-Party SDKs
This app is built with the Unity engine, which may access device information required for functionality such as compass orientation or location services. Unity does not collect personal data unless explicitly configured for analytics or ads, which we do not use.

Children’s Privacy
Our app is suitable for general use and does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
